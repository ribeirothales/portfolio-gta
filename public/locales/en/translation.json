    "about2": "My journey in tech started early: still in high school, I learned HTML, CSS, and Photoshop, building small websites on my own. Since then, Iâ€™ve continued to deepen my knowledge, exploring languages like C (my first programming language), Java, and Python. Now, focused on JavaScript, I mainly use Node.js for back-end development and React with Tailwind for the front-end.",
    "about3": "I started studying Computer Science at UFRJ but decided to take a break and pursue a different academic path â€” I'm a bachelor in Philosophy, which greatly enhanced my logical thinking and analytical skills. Now, Iâ€™m back in the tech world, more focused than ever on building a solid career as a developer.",
